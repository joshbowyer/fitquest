# FitQuest Roadmap

> Audited against the actual codebase — every "done" item has
> working code reachable via a URL. "Outstanding" items are sized
> + scoped for the next session.

## Operations

- **Run `npx prisma migrate deploy` after every pull.** The api
  Dockerfile runs it on container startup, but **`npm run dev` does
  not** — devs running `tsx watch` locally need to run it manually
  after pulling new code. The `20260701090000_measurement_unique_user_metric_date`
  migration can fail on existing installs that accumulated duplicate
  Measurement rows from old FIT re-imports; if it does, run the
  dedup query in the migration's comment and then
  `npx prisma migrate resolve --applied 20260701090000_measurement_unique_user_metric_date`.


## Active (in progress)

(none — picking from the backlog next)

## Backlog (from user notes, in priority order)

### Bugs / data-correctness

- **New-user dashboard radials don't populate** after entering
  measurements. Only `LEAN_MASS` + `FFMI` (the auto-derived
  ones) render; the others (`BODY_FAT_PCT`, `WEIGHT`, `WAIST`,
  `SHOULDER_WAIST_RATIO`) stay blank even after a measurement
  is logged. Likely cause: the WEIGHT/BODY_FAT_PCT radials read
  from the `Measurement` table but the new-user flow writes
  them only to `User.weightKg` / `User.bodyFatPct`. Fallback
  to the User row when no Measurement exists.
- **New-user HomeBase shield starts at 60, not 100.** Code at
  `api/src/lib/penance.ts:198-208` and `api/src/routes/habits.ts:194-198`
  both create HomeBase with `shield: 100, tier: 'FORTIFIED'`.
  User reports shield=60 on a fresh account. Need to confirm
  whether something fires between registration and first
  HomeBase GET that drops shield by 40, or whether the user is
  on a stale image.

### Polish

- **Medical metrics UI.** Surface existing RHR / sleep / stress
  for medical history. Schema has the data but no medical-themed
  UI (no "history of resting HR" chart, no BP log form, etc).
- **Personal records page** — all PRs in one view with charts
  over time. Currently /prs/WorkoutDetail shows individual PRs
  but no aggregated "all my PRs over time" view.
- **Mobile polish** (small wins) — long-press to multi-select on
  history, pull-to-refresh on Dashboard, haptic feedback on rest
  timer completion.
- **3D avatar polish** — animations on level completion. The
  recently-worked indicator already brightens recently-trained
  parts (static, not animated) so the user can see at a glance
  what was worked; the level-up animation already fires via
  RewardOverlay. What's left is making the level-up animation
  more cinematic and a stronger workout-logged effect.
- **Skills page revisit** — the page exists but the user wants
  to walk through it again. (Scope: see what currently works,
  identify gaps.)

### Identity / auth

- **Admin: reset all users' items.** Add a button on the admin
  page that wipes the `InventoryItem` table (and resets any
  related state) so the user can clear test items from the prod
  server. Confirm with the user if equip/loadout state should
  also reset.

## Stretch / Future

- **AI HUD agent** — Cortana-style assistant that knows your
  data and can answer questions ("how did I sleep this week?").
  Could be an LLM-powered insights panel that calls into the
  same APIs the dashboard does.
- **Gadgetbridge live push/pull** — uploads land via the
  FitQuestBridge helper APK (vanilla Gadgetbridge + SAF-granted
  export dir + bridge APK watching the dir). The PR for
  upstream Gadgetbridge is no longer blocking. Next step: add
  a "rebuild & install" reminder to the bridge's notification
  when GB's API changes (rare).
- **Nutrition tracker enhancements** — barcode lookup,
  restaurant menu scan, etc. The base tracker is live (AI
  estimated macros from free-text descriptions).
- **Native Android app** — wrap the web app (or build native)
  for scheduled toast notifications / reminders for workouts,
  weigh-ins, recovery, examen, etc. Web push can do some of
  this but native has reliable scheduled local notifications,
  background sync, and homescreen widgets. Use Capacitor /
  TWA / RN / native — pick after scoping.
- **Sound / audio system** — SFX for level-up, raid damage,
  rest-timer done, workout logged, boss defeat, leak spawn.
  Currently silent. Needs an audio service (howler.js / web
  audio API), mute toggle in user prefs, and per-event hooks
  fired from the existing event system.
- **3D avatar / STATUS hologram polish.**

## Recently Fixed / Resolved

- ✅ FitQuestBridge APK: SAF-only storage model (no root, no
  Magisk toasts, no MANAGE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE). Earlier versions
  either read GB's app-private dir at
  `/sdcard/Android/data/nodomain.freeyourgadget.gadgetbridge/files/`
  via root/`MANAGE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` — both kicked off a Magisk
  "superuser granted" toast on every periodic poll, and the
  permission toggle was unstable on Android 14. Replaced with
  a SAF-only model: the user picks a directory via
  `ACTION_OPEN_DOCUMENT_TREE`, the bridge takes a persistable
  URI permission, and all reads go through `ContentResolver` +
  `DocumentsContract`. Trade-off: the user has to point
  Gadgetbridge's `AutoExport FIT` setting at the same
  directory (a one-time config change, not a code change). No
  root required, no special permissions, no toasts, works on
  every Android 5+ device the bridge supports.
- ✅ Mobile top-bar title overlap (Layout.tsx). The FIT//QUEST
  title was `absolute left-0 right-0 text-center` on mobile so
  the new 10-heart hero row in Dashboard.tsx overlapped with it
  on narrow viewports. Switched the title to a natural flex
  child (`shrink-0` next to the hamburger) so it sits flush
  right of the menu icon, left of center, instead of centered
  across the whole header. Desktop layout unchanged (hamburger
  hidden, title in the same left-edge position).
- ✅ FitQuestBridge helper APK + Bearer-token auth. New long-lived
  `DEVICE` session kind on `Session` table (1-year TTL, sha-stored
  token via standard Session.token column). New `readBearerToken` /
  `getDeviceSession` helpers in `api/src/lib/auth.ts`; `requireUser`
  now accepts `Authorization: Bearer <token>` AND falls back to
  cookie session (cookie is the source of truth for the web app,
  Bearer is for unattended clients — they don't share tokens).
  Endpoints:
  - `POST /auth/device-login` — username + password (+ optional
    TOTP code) → `{ token, expiresAt, user }`. Re-running deletes
    prior DEVICE sessions for the user (rotation).
  - `POST /auth/device-logout` — revokes the calling Bearer token.
  - `GET /auth/device-sessions` — lists active tokens (web UI
    surfaces in /settings so the user can revoke a lost phone).
  - `DELETE /auth/device-sessions/:id` — revoke one token.
  - `POST /auth/logout-everywhere` — now also wipes DEVICE sessions.
  Failed closed: a malformed Bearer rejects the request even if a
  valid cookie is also present, so a typo'd token never accidentally
  authenticates as the web user. 21 unit tests in
  `api/src/__tests__/deviceLogin.test.ts` (all pass).
  End-to-end smoke verified: real FIT upload via Bearer → 200, 2
  rows created in DB. The FitQuestBridge APK lives at
  `/home/josh/claw-code/FitQuestBridge/`, ~7MB debug APK. Setup
  flow: install APK → enter server URL + credentials (+ TOTP if
  2FA on) → pick the watch directory via SAF → tap Start → the
  bridge uploads new `.fit` files to `/import/batch` in the
  background. Works with vanilla Gadgetbridge: point GB's
  AutoExport FIT directory at the same SAF-granted directory the
  bridge watches.
- ✅ Negative weight values for bodyweight + band exercises.
  Set-weight schema in `api/src/routes/workouts.ts:100` was
  `z.number().min(0).max(2000)` — rejected band-assisted work
  (a 20kg band pulling up on a pull-up is roughly -20kg of
  effective load). Relaxed to `min(-500).max(2000)`; floor
  covers the heaviest commercial band stacks, ceiling still
  flags obvious typos. Frontend weight inputs in
  `LiveWorkoutLogger.tsx` (target + current), `WorkoutLogger.tsx`
  and `pages/Workouts.tsx` (bulk-mode) all bumped from
  `min={0}` to `min={-500}` and the placeholders now read
  `kg · − for band assist` (or `lb · − for band assist` for
  imperial users). Reps / duration / RPE inputs untouched.
- ✅ USCCB readings: stale UI message + diagnostic endpoint. The
  "No USCCB reading available right now" message was stale (didn't
  mention EWTN, which has been the primary source since the
  redesign). New `GET /spiritual/readings-status` endpoint probes
  each source independently (cache / EWTN / RSS / Wayback) and
  returns ok/error/empty per source with a reason string. New
  `POST /spiritual/readings-reseed?date=YYYY-MM-DD` endpoint
  force-refreshes the cascade and returns the new status. The
  SpiritualDirectorCard error path now:
  - updates the message to name all 4 sources in the cascade
  - adds a "Force reseed" button that hits the new endpoint +
    invalidates the director query
  - adds a "Diagnose" expandable chip that pulls the status
    endpoint and shows ✓/✗ per source with the failure reason.
- ✅ Morning popup modal (Habitica-style). Auto-shows once per day
  on /today (localStorage-dismissed per local-date). Shows heart
  counter animation (Hardcore only) that counts down from 5 to
  current value over 1.2s with ease-out cubic, the heart-loss
  reasons from yesterday (each of the 6 triggers), a 4-cell
  recap (workout/sleep/weigh-in/recovery, green or rose per
  floor), and a list of unchecked dailies with one-tap
  "mark done" buttons (idempotent — uses the existing
  /dailies/:id/complete endpoint). Backend: new
  `GET /dailies/morning-popup?date=YYYY-MM-DD` endpoint bundles
  the full payload. Tests in
  `api/src/__tests__/morningPopupPayload.test.ts` lock the
  response shape.
- ✅ Supersets in the live workout. New `groupIndex Int?` column
  on `WorkoutTemplateExercise` + `Exercise` (migration
  `20260703090000_superset_group_index`). Routines page got a
  "Pair with next" button and a neon-magenta pair label (1A/1B/2A
  ...). Live logger walks exercises round-robin via a new pure
  `buildRoundRobinOrder` helper (`web/src/lib/supersetRoundRobin.ts`),
  with 12 unit tests covering empty input, linear singletons,
  paired alternation, asymmetric set counts, 3-exercise groups,
  multi-pair ordering, mixed paired/un-paired, zero-set members,
  and singleton groupIndex. API extended to accept/persist
  `groupIndex` on both template and workout create paths;
  backwards-compatible (null = linear). Bulk logger shows the
  pair label as a visual indicator only (bulk mode doesn't walk
  in real-time).
- ✅ Live workout — 5 of 6 reported bugs fixed. `autoFocus` on the
  weight input removed (mobile keyboard no longer pops unprompted).
  "Finish workout" gets a belt-and-suspenders `disabled` guard on
  `createM.isPending` so double-taps can't re-fire the commit (the
  existing fix at commit `eff47ad` was likely just behind a stale
  docker image — pulling the new build should resolve the user-
  reported hang). Predefined routine prefill now gates on
  `selectedTemplateQ.isSuccess` so the logger doesn't mount with a
  stale `templatePrefill=null` snapshot. New `Workout.postNotes`
  column + rest-screen textarea on the final set for post-session
  reflection (bulk mode shows it inline). CapturedSet gains a
  `locked: boolean` field; the new history strip below the live
  entry lists every captured set with a per-row ✎ Edit / ✓ Lock
  toggle so accidental taps can't overwrite mid-workout. (6th bug,
  supersets, deferred — needs schema migration + state-machine
  rewrite.)
- ✅ Supersets in the live workout. New `groupIndex Int?` column
  on `WorkoutTemplateExercise` + `Exercise` (migration
  `20260703090000_superset_group_index`). Routines page got a
  "Pair with next" button and a neon-magenta pair label (1A/1B/2A
  ...). Live logger walks exercises round-robin via a new pure
  `buildRoundRobinOrder` helper (`web/src/lib/supersetRoundRobin.ts`),
  with 12 unit tests covering empty input, linear singletons,
  paired alternation, asymmetric set counts, 3-exercise groups,
  multi-pair ordering, mixed paired/un-paired, zero-set members,
  and singleton groupIndex. API extended to accept/persist
  `groupIndex` on both template and workout create paths;
  backwards-compatible (null = linear). Bulk logger shows the
  pair label as a visual indicator only (bulk mode doesn't walk
  in real-time).
- ✅ Tron identity disk scales to body measurements. New
  migration `20260705090000_body_measurements_for_avatar` adds
  `shoulderCm` + `waistCm` columns to User. Avatar.tsx now scales:
  - outer ring radius (shoulders, ±25%),
  - inner ring radius (waist, inverse — tighter waist = bigger gap),
  - figure X scale via V-taper (shoulder/waist ratio, ±35%),
  - figure Y scale (height, ±25%),
  - ring stroke width (broader builds = chunkier ring).
  Profile page exposes Shoulder width + Waist inputs. MES/AVG/END
  somatotype badge below the disc when measurements are present
  so the user can see the avatar is reading their build. Reference
  values 110cm shoulders / 80cm waist / 175cm height.
- ✅ Username case-insensitive login. New `User.usernameLower
  String @unique` column populated via `LOWER(username)`. Login
  route looks up by `usernameLower` so `LobsterWrangler`,
  `lobsterwrangler`, and `LOBSTERWRANGLER` all resolve to the same
  account. Display name (`username`) still preserves the case the
  user typed. Migration `20260704000000_username_lower` adds the
  column with a UNIQUE constraint that fails loudly if two existing
  users collide (e.g. "Bob" + "bob") so the operator can manually
  merge before re-running. Parties route invite-by-username also
  case-folds. `ensureDefaultAdmin` populates `usernameLower` for
  fresh installs.
- ✅ USCCB readings: EWTN is the new primary source (replaced
  USCCB's broken RSS feed). The api walks the cascade
  cache → EWTN → USCCB RSS → Wayback on every miss. New
  `GET /spiritual/readings-status` endpoint probes each source
  independently with a reason; `POST /spiritual/readings-reseed`
  force-refreshes. SpiritualDirectorCard now has a "Diagnose"
  chip that shows per-source ✓/✗ so the user can see which leg
  of the cascade is broken instead of staring at a generic
  "no reading" message.
- ✅ Hardcore-mode heart-loss system wired up. `loseHeart()`
  had zero callers until this commit. New
  `fireHardcoreHeartPenalties()` runs alongside
  `fireMissedAllDailiesPenance()` in the morning-report sweep.
  6 triggers, each can independently cost a heart on a given
  local day: MISSED_WORKOUT, MISSED_ALL_DAILIES,
  SUBSTANCE_CAFFEINE, SUBSTANCE_ALCOHOL, SUBSTANCE_NICOTINE,
  ZERO_SPIRITUAL. Nicotine cap added (2/week — most
  restrictive of the three). HeartLossEvent table +
  HeartLossTrigger enum + unique (userId, kind, sourceDate)
  index for natural idempotency. Tests in heartLoss.test.ts
  (11/11 pass).
- ✅ Sleep onset FIT parser. parseSleep now emits a
  SLEEP_ONSET Measurement row with the fractional-hour of
  the start event bucketed to local midnight of the
  night-of-sleep (post-midnight starts → previous calendar
  day so the chart's X-axis matches how the user thinks
  about it). parseFit now accepts an optional tz arg that
  threads through to the parser. /import/summary now
  includes recentSleepOnset in the response. Two new
  timezone helpers (hoursSinceLocalMidnightInTz,
  localNightStartInTz) hoisted into api/src/lib/timezone.ts
  so the parser and the correlation engines share one
  implementation. The original sleepOnsetDate.test.ts was
  vacuously passing (`if (!onset) continue;` skipped the
  assertions when no onset was found) and used a wrong
  function signature — rewritten with deterministic
  timezone-helper unit tests.
- ✅ Pain entries on Today (was: "persist silently on Status").
  New `PainCard` component surfaces the most-recent active pain
  log (intensity > 0) on Today with a 14-day "is it going down?"
  sparkline, a "Pain is gone" quick-action that posts
  intensity=0 for the same body part, and an Update button
  re-opening the log modal at the active part. Empty-state copy
  points users to the body map on /status for full logging.
- ✅ Recovery practices → Today (was: "should be on Today").
  Extracted the checklist + state + helpers into a new
  `RecoveryPracticesPanel` component, rendered on Today between
  the quick-action grid and the dailies/check-ins columns.
  State persists in localStorage (`fitquest:recovery:practiceLog`)
  so it stays in sync if the user navigates to /recovery too.
  Removed the block from /recovery; dropped the now-unused
  `completedPractices` PageHeader highlight check.
- ✅ Weekly Examen copy typo. "where was God in neither" →
  "where was God in all this" (Ignatian phrasing the user
  picked). Touches panel intro, both summary labels, and the
  modal field label. No DB / test changes.
- ✅ Body weight graph zoom (Insights). `yPad` 20 → 10 so the
  line shows more dynamism within the recorded range instead
  of being squashed to the bottom of the plot area.
- ✅ Status page Identity block weight from weigh-ins. Now
  prefers today's tz-aware weigh-in (`/measurements/weigh-in/
  status`, same endpoint WeighInPanel uses) and falls back to
  `user.weightKg` when no weigh-in has been logged today.
- ✅ Recent PRs block — rename + data source. Title "Recent
  PRs" → "Estimated 1RM peaks" (matches what the panel
  actually shows — the Epley estimate, not raw PR weight).
  Endpoint `/prs/best` (max ever per exercise) → `/prs`
  (chronological recent Pr rows). "Recent" now actually means
  recent instead of "max ever, in insertion order".
- ✅ Equipment drops / loot (world → loot table mapping). Added
  `classForWorld()` helper; Spire drops Juggernaut gear, Glade
  drops Phantom gear, Citadel drops Berserker gear, etc. NEUTRAL
  worlds (crossroads, nexus, breach) stay unfiltered. Wired into
  `maybeSpawnLeak` (uses most-recently-cleared world level),
  `maybeSpawnBreachLeak` (no filter), `claimKill` in Breach
  (filtered by `boss.classAffinity`, ANY = unfiltered), world
  boss defeat (filtered by URL `worldId`), and quest level
  first-clear (~25% drop chance themed by world). Uses existing
  `ItemDef.classRestriction` column — no schema migration needed.
  Tests in `worldLoot.test.ts` (10/10 pass).
- ✅ Genetic Max minimums audit. SHOULDER `defaultMin` 38cm →
  89cm (was displaying as 15in imperial — now ~35in floor,
  matches Casey Butt circumference semantic; web/types.ts had
  drifted to biacromial breadth context which conflicted with
  the API label + formulas). CALF 35cm → 30cm (accommodates
  user's 12.7in actual). FFMI 18 → 15 (sedentary adult-male
  floor). FIVE_K_TIME 1500s → 900s (was 25min; elite is ~13min).
  ONE_MILE_TIME 360s → 240s (was 6min; elite is ~4min). Applied
  to both `api/src/lib/metrics.ts` and `web/src/lib/types.ts`
  to keep them in sync. Tests in `metricFloors.test.ts` (6/6).
- ✅ Inventory: drop Preview panel + move Stats From Equipment to
  the left column (between Equipped Loadout and Item Catalogue).
  Right column is item-detail only.
- ✅ Morning Checkins cache invalidation bug: WeighInPanel +
  Import page now `qc.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: ['check-ins'] })`
  after their writes, so the dashboard's check-in cards refresh
  with today's data instead of showing the stale "due" list.
- ✅ Spiritual + recovery penance events (7 new PenanceKey
  entries): `missed_spiritual_week`, `missed_examen`,
  `missed_recovery_week`, `missed_hrv` (damage) and
  `completed_spiritual_day`, `logged_recovery_week`,
  `logged_sleep_8h` (repair). Each has a label + flavor text.
  Tests in `penanceEvents.test.ts` (25/25 pass).
- ✅ Portal-leak stacking: `maybeSpawnLeak` no longer
  short-circuits if an active leak exists. `getLeakForUser` now
  returns all active leaks oldest-first + per-leak recent damage
  events. The frontend shows a "× N" queue badge on the
  homebase alert and a "#N of M" queue index on /portal-leak.
  The user explicitly requested: "if ive been slipping and have
  earned three monsters there should be three active".
- ✅ 3 new insight rules: `plateau_detected`, `water_low_recent`,
  `sleep_recovery_mismatch` (tests in `insightRulesExtended.test.ts`).
- ✅ All sprite assets updated. 91 catalog sprites + 9 boss
  portraits + 15 monster portraits all use the green-screen +
  isnet-soft pipeline. No halo / shadow / smudge artifacts.
  Walker cane, plain cotton, sabatons regenerated specifically
  with the green-screen method (synthesized versions were
  rejected as "shit" by the user).
- ✅ Portal-leak attack flow: opening the workout logger inline
  from the leak alert now auto-fires `/workouts/:id/leak-damage`
  on commit. The user sees depleted HP immediately.
- ✅ Walking cane wired to BOTH possible paths
  (items/weapon_healer_1.png AND gear/weapons/oracle.png) so
  the seed can point at either.
- ✅ Per-item sprite manifest regenerated by
  `npm run sprites:manifest`.
- ✅ Quest threshold-based auto-completion
- ✅ Routine + streak system (consistency bonus, no penalty)
- ✅ Rest timer + copy-last-session + history filters
- ✅ Workout form polish (autocomplete, bodyweight detection,
  unit conversion, muscle preview)
- ✅ 3D body hologram with pain/worked/recovery overlays
- ✅ Mobile polish (bottom nav, responsive grids, safe-area insets)
- ✅ Tron identity disc avatar
- ✅ Quest overworld with animations
- ✅ Pain logging system
- ✅ 5571-minute walking-session insight bug (Workout.duration
  unit fix, migration 20260627090000_fix_fit_duration_units)
- ✅ Class-lock badge color fix (oracle now periwinkle, not gray)
- ✅ Tie quest boss unlocks to world completion
- ✅ More worlds — Nexus + Breach
- ✅ Breach world reset on Maw defeat (cycle field, 10 Maw variants)
- ✅ Breach ↔ Raid integration (PortalLeak.worldSource + breach badge)
- ✅ Live mode "Finish workout" hang fix (fire commit in the
  "no more sets" branch of advanceToNextSet)
- ✅ Quest homebase overhaul (consolidation to single page with
  Open Galaxy Map overlay, Breach indicator, leak modal)
- ✅ 2FA / TOTP
- ✅ Data export (JSON + CSV)
- ✅ FIT / GPX imports
- ✅ Gadgetbridge ingest (upload-only)
- ✅ Nutrition tracker (Foods/Meals routes + Nutrition page)
- ✅ Body composition timeline chart
  (BodyComp.tsx with 30d/90d/6mo/1yr windows)

## Nice-to-haves (backlog)

- Dark/light theme toggle (currently only dark)
- Push notifications (web push API for homebase shield drops,
  breach defeat, etc.)

## Dropped

- ~~Email verification + password reset.~~ No email integration
  in this app. Dropped per user direction.
